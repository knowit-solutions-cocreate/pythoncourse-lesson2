# Excercises

## Before you start
Familiarise yourself with reading from and writing to SQL using pandas by studying sql_read_example.py and sql_write_to_example.py. Try, for example, modifying sql_write_to_example.py, executing it with `py .\lesson_2_code\sql_write_to_example.py` then viewing the result in SQLite Viewer in VSCode.

You can always start over by deleting lesson2.db and recreating it using the instructions above.


## Main exercises

### 1. Replace SQL-side join with a Python/pandas-side join
In lesson_2_code/populate_homeworlds_table.py there is a pure SQL-query which populates a table by combining the people information with that about their home planets.

Task: replace the SQL-side join with logic that loads the two tables into pandas dataframes, carries out the join using pandas then loads the result back using the `.to_sql` function. Drop columns whose elements contain URLs or lists of URLs. Keep the rest of the columns.

Hints:
- how to read an SQL table into pandas is shown in sql_read_example.py
- how to write a pandas datafram into an SQL table is shown in sql_write_to_example.py
- in pandas, `.merge` is actually more similar to SQL's `JOIN` than `.join`

### 2. Data cleaning
Upon inspecting the homeworlds table you should find that there are a few issues when it comes to data representation. For example, some columns represent some missing values with NULL and others with "none", and some columns are stored with strings despite the information being numeric.

We suggest implementing all steps of this exercise in the same file. You could start by copying the contents of sql_read_example.py to a new file called clean_homeworlds.py.

#### a. Properly represent missing values
Task: replace NULL-representing strings such as "unknown" and "none" with values that translate to proper NULLs in the database.

Hints: pandas provides multiple functionalities that help with this. `.replace` and `.where` are two examples.

#### b. Represent height as integer
Task: convert the string representation of the height column to int.

Hints: the convenience function `pd.to_numeric` usually does what you want in this context. Have a look at its documentation.

#### c. Represent mass and birth_year as float
Task: convert the string representations of the mass and birth_year columns to float.

Hints: This is trickier than b because a little bit of string-preprocessing is required before `pd.to_numeric` will work. Namely, there is a decimal comma that needs to replaced with a regular decimal dot and a "BBY" (short for "Before the Battle of Yavin", apparently) substring that needs to be removed. In pandas, you can access convenience string manipulation functions in the `pd.Series.str` property: try typing `df["mass"].str.` into VSCode and scroll through the suggestions to find what you need.

#### d. Save the result in a new table
Task: save the result of applying all the three cleaning procedures to a new table.

Hints: lesson_2_code/sql_write_to_example.py.

### 3. Add new entries to a table using requests, an f-string-formatted query URL, dictionary lookup and a loop
Note that this is *hard*!

Task: TODO

Hints:
- TODO example code that queries a different swapi resource (perhaps films, because it's small), constructs a dataframe from the list of dicts then prints it


## Bonus exercises

### 1. Extend the command line interface
The command line interface, that is used to run `lesson2 db create` and `lesson2 db populate` setup steps, is implemented in lesson_2_code/\_\_init__.py. How it works should be fairly clear from the code and the output of `lesson2 --help` and `lesson2 db --help`. Try adding a new "action" for populating the homeworlds table or, if you did all three main exercise, why not an action that first fetches new data is in main exercise 3, then refreshes the other tables?

### 2. Publish your package (locally to yourself)
Full package publication to a remote package index (place online that others can install your Python code from) is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but here is a local example that should give you some understanding of what's going on and more confidence for when you do need to publish something properly :)

First, pip install the "build" package, then use it to build your package to a local location:
```console
py -m build -o package-index/lesson-2-code
```
If you have a look inside the generated folder, you will find that there is nothing that foreign in there - just a compressed archive (.tar.gz) of the code, named according to a convention that includes the package version. Furthermore, the folder package-index is now a fully valid package index. To make it available (to your own computer, at least), serve its contents using Python's built-in web server:
```console
cd package-index
py -m http.server  # serve folder content to http://localhost:8000
```

While the webserver is running in one Powershell terminal, you may open a new one, create an entirely new virtual environment in it, then install the code via the web server:
```console
py -m pip install --extra-index-url http://localhost:8000 lesson-2-code
```
And voil√†! You should find that not only the project code became available as an importable package, but also the CLI. Have a look in further reading for hints on where you can learn to publish packages indexes accessible by others.
